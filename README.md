# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
>We were given the task of analyzing the given election audit of a recent local congressional election. if we specify the task then;
1- Total number of votes
2- List of candidates 
3- Total number of votes each candidate received
4- Percantage of votes of each canditates
5- List of counties
6- county vote percentages
7- Finding a winner and it's statistics. 
## Resources 
> Data : election_results.csv 
>Software : Python 3.9.2 , Visual Studio , GitHub Desktop
## Summary 
> The analysis of election show that: 
There were 369,711 votes cast in recent local congressional election.
> The Canditates were: \n
1- Charles Casper Stockham\n
2- Diana DeGette\n
3- Raymon Anthony Doane\n
> The Canditate results were: 
1- Charles Casper Stockham : 23.0% (85,213)\n
2- Diana DeGette : 73.8% (272,892)\n
3- Raymon Anthony Doane : 3.1% (11,606)\n
>Counties with votes were:\n
1-Jefferson : 10.5% (85,213)\n
2-Denver : 82.8% (306,055)\n
3-Arapahoe : 6.7% (24,801)\n
> The winner of the Election was :  Diana DeGette with a 73.8% votes which is 272,892 in total. 
## Challenge Overview
> In this challenge we have encountered a huge oppurtiny to understand the basics of list,directions,dictionaries. Also reading and analyzing the
CSV(comma seperated values) files was one of the main goals. 
### Methods and Difficulties
> To achieve the given tasks; for loops, logical operators, print statements were used. To begin with it is stated that the creating a pseudo code is essential. To understand the algorith and process pseudo code can give us a amazing boost. Difficulties can be categorized in two parts: Retrieving data and writing a code. Some technical issues can be frustrating but you can always finding an another solution. In this projects cloning problems were occured. And using the Github Desktop Software help us to fix the problems. Another issue is we need to forced to git to push into a repository. Code problems can be listed as: correcting a spelling, determining the level of each line commands and creating a meaningful variables and list. Visual Studio gives the right feedbacks to overcome the problems.
## Challange Summary
>Overall this challange was the hardest one we faced so far. But overall it gave us too many results and findings. Especially a focused mind can overcome any given problems. By using different methods and languages one more big step was taken into a Data Analitics Journey. Also Git Bash and command prompt were used and it is showed us how to be more efficient in any different language as long as you know the main parts.
